If you are having trouble installing the kernel module, make sure you have
* the correct kernel sources installed for your active kernel
* provided the correct signing certificate and private key. Make sure you are using a key accepted by your system. If using a self-signed module, make sure you [enrolled the MOK](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/F22978_01/tutorial-uefi-secureboot-module/).

If you cannot fix your problems this way, please try to ask your question to our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/innomotics-oss).
